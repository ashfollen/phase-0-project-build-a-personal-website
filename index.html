                Welcome to my page! My name is Ashley Follen. I'm a new England native, currently residing in Boulder County, Colorado. The story of my adult years began as a business student focusing on finance and computer information systems. In the 10 years since undergrad, I've relocated to the remote ski town in Telluride, CO, then to Boulder County. My career has transitioned from a financial analyst to an accountant, to a front end website manager, back to an accountant, and now to a student in the software engineering bootcamp course at the Flatiron School.
